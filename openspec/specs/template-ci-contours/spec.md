# template-ci-contours Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-agent-toolkit-and-ci-contours. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Layered CI Contours

The template SHALL define separate CI contours for static checks, fixture-level verification, and real 1C runtime execution.

#### Scenario: Template and generated projects run appropriate checks

- **WHEN** CI is configured from the template
- **THEN** it MUST distinguish between checks that can run without a real 1C runtime and checks that require a provisioned runtime environment
- **AND** the static and fixture contours MUST be runnable in ordinary automation environments

### Requirement: Runtime Contour Isolation

The runtime CI contour SHALL be isolated from generic CI environments and explicitly targeted to provisioned 1C infrastructure.

#### Scenario: Runtime jobs avoid unsafe shared execution

- **WHEN** a workflow includes operations that need licensed 1C binaries, real infobases, or secret connection settings
- **THEN** those jobs MUST target self-hosted or equivalently provisioned runners
- **AND** the template MUST document that such jobs are not mandatory for every shared CI execution

### Requirement: Safe Secret Handling

The CI design SHALL avoid storing real runtime credentials or destructive environment details in the template repository.

#### Scenario: Generated project configures runtime jobs

- **WHEN** a generated project enables runtime contour jobs
- **THEN** the repository MUST rely on external secrets or environment configuration for credentials and sensitive connection data
- **AND** the template MUST only ship examples and documentation, not live secrets
